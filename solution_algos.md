# Rubik's Cube Solution Algorithms

## Korf's algorithm

- method: [IDA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_A*) (iterative depending A*)
- Although this algorithm will always find an optimal solution, its **search time is considerably longer** than
  Kociemba's or Feather's algorithm.

## Feather's algorithm
- 6 colors -> 3 colors
